two bugs in one

1. `netlify-edge` broke when using solid start (`Invalid value for option "output.manualChunks" - this option is not supported for "output.inlineDynamicImports".
`)
1. `netlify` broke when using standalone nitro (`Error: Could not load node:buffer (imported by node_modules/unenv/dist/runtime/polyfill/buffer.mjs): ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'node:buffer'
`)
